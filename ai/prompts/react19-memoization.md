Here’s a concise yet comprehensive breakdown of the key points from the DEV article, enriched with insights from additional sources:

A new React Compiler (formerly “React Forget”) shipped alongside React 19 automates component- and hook-level memoization at build time, eliminating most uses of useMemo, useCallback, and React.memo in day-to-day code  ￼. Before React 19, developers manually wrapped expensive computations and callbacks to prevent unnecessary re-renders—a pattern that added boilerplate and complexity  ￼. The compiler statically analyzes your code, inlines dependency checks, and injects caching logic so that plain functions and values behave as if memoized, producing leaner, more readable components without runtime cost from allocation of closures or dependency arrays  ￼ ￼. You still may need useMemo or useCallback for specialized scenarios—like interfacing with third-party libs that expect memoized inputs or guarding very heavy calculations that fall outside typical patterns—but these are now clearly edge cases  ￼ ￼. Adoption is opt-in via a Babel/ESLint plugin today, with a stable Compiler release expected later in 2025 as React 19 rolls out fully  ￼ ￼.

1. Why We Memoized Manually (Pre-React 19)

Before React 19:
	•	Default Behavior: Every render recreated inline functions and recomputed values, even if inputs didn’t change  ￼.
	•	Use of Hooks: Developers used useMemo(() ⇒ expensiveCalc, [deps]) and useCallback(() ⇒ handler, [deps]) to cache results and stabilize function references  ￼.
	•	Drawbacks: Overuse led to cluttered code, error-prone dependency arrays, and potential performance regressions if misconfigured  ￼.

2. The React Compiler: Automatic Build-Time Memoization

2.1 What It Is
	•	A build-time tool introduced with React 19 that transforms your component code to include memoization automatically  ￼ ￼.
	•	Formerly known as “React Forget,” it uses static analysis to detect pure rendering logic and injects optimized inline caching  ￼ ￼.

2.2 How It Works
	1.	Static Analysis: Scans component and hook definitions to identify stable values and functions.
	2.	Code Transformation: Rewrites code to inline dependency checks and reuse cached results rather than wrapping everything in hooks  ￼.
	3.	Opt-In Plugin: Enabled via babel-plugin-react-compiler@rc (or SWC plugin), plus an ESLint integration to ensure React rules compliance  ￼ ￼.

2.3 Benefits
	•	Cleaner Code: You write plain functions; the compiler handles memoization  ￼.
	•	Reduced Boilerplate: Eliminates most useMemo/useCallback imports and wrapper code  ￼.
	•	Consistent Optimization: Applies best-practice patterns uniformly, surfacing only true edge cases for manual tuning  ￼.

3. Edge Cases: When Manual Memoization Still Matters

Although React 19 handles ~90% of scenarios automatically, consider manual memoization when:
	•	Third-Party Requirements: Libraries explicitly demand stable references (e.g., callback props to deeply memoized children)  ￼.
	•	Extremely Heavy Computes: Computations so costly that even optimized inline checks aren’t enough—and you want to control cache scope or lifetime yourself  ￼.
	•	Custom Hooks with Dynamic Logic: When hook internals violate React’s static rules, the compiler safely opts out, and you may need manual caching  ￼.

4. Adoption Roadmap & Best Practices

4.1 Release Timeline
	•	React 19 Core: Released with new APIs; the Compiler itself remains experimental in 2025’s early RCs  ￼.
	•	Stable Release: Anticipated by end of 2025—watch the React blog for updates  ￼.

4.2 Getting Started
	1.	Install Plugins

npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-react-compiler@rc eslint-plugin-react-hooks@^6.0.0-rc.1

￼

	2.	Configure Babel/ESLint per the official React Compiler docs  ￼.
	3.	Run Health Check with npx react-compiler-healthcheck@latest to ensure your code follows the Rules of React  ￼.

4.3 Best Practices
	•	“Write Simple First”: Build components without manual memoization and rely on compiler optimizations.
	•	Measure, Don’t Guess: Use profiling tools before adding manual useMemo/useCallback.
	•	Stay Updated: Follow the React Compiler Working Group and GitHub discussions for real-world feedback  ￼.

By embracing the React Compiler, teams can offload routine optimization to the build step, centralize caching logic, and reclaim developer focus for core UI logic—while retaining manual tools for truly exceptional cases.
