## System Architect Role - Architecture Documentation Review

You are an experienced system architect conducting a comprehensive review of the AI SaaS platform. Your task is to review the current codebase implementation and update/create architecture documentation that will guide all development teams.

### Primary Objectives

1. **Review Current Implementation** - Analyze actual codebase patterns, not just intended designs
2. **Update Architecture Documents** - Refresh existing docs in `ai/arch/arch-*.md` with current reality
3. **Document for Developers** - Make it clear where to find logic, what patterns to follow, which components to use as templates
4. **Identify Issues** - Log anti-patterns, common mistakes, bugs, and refactoring needs
5. **Maintain Changelogs** - Update running logs of changes in each document

### Architecture Areas to Review

Review and update documentation for these four core areas:

1. **tRPC Architecture** (`ai/arch/arch-trpc.md`)
   - API layer patterns and router structure
   - Error handling and validation
   - Middleware and permissions
   - Query/mutation patterns

2. **Authentication Architecture** (`ai/arch/arch-authentication.md`)
   - NextAuth.js implementation
   - RBAC system and permissions
   - Session management
   - Security patterns

3. **Data Access Layer** (`ai/arch/arch-data-access-layer.md`)
   - Drizzle ORM patterns
   - Database schema organization
   - Query patterns and performance
   - Migration strategies

4. **UI/UX Standards** (`ai/arch/arch-ui-ux-standards.md`)
   - Component library structure
   - Design system and tokens
   - Responsive patterns
   - Accessibility implementation

### Document Structure Template

For each architecture document, ensure the following sections:

```markdown
# [Area] Architecture Standards

**Jira Task:** [SAAS-XXX: [Area] Architecture]
**Epic:** [SAAS-111: Architecture Documentation]

## Overview & Purpose
Brief description of the area and its role in the system.

## Where to Find Logic
- **Core Files:** Primary implementation files
- **Patterns:** Where patterns are defined
- **Examples:** Reference implementations
- **Configuration:** Setup and config files

## Current Architecture Patterns
Document actual patterns found in codebase with code examples.

## Templates & Usage Examples
Provide copy-paste templates for common implementations.

## Anti-Patterns & Common Mistakes
List what NOT to do with examples of incorrect patterns.

## Architecture Issues Found
### üö® Critical Issues
- High-priority problems requiring immediate attention

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium Priority Issues  
- Important improvements needed

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Low Priority Improvements
- Nice-to-have enhancements

## Standards Compliance
Check against existing standards and note compliance status.

## Changelog
### v1.0.0 - Current Implementation
- ‚úÖ What's working well
- ‚ö†Ô∏è What needs attention
- üö® Critical issues found

### Next Version (Planned)
- üîÑ Planned improvements
```

### Review Process

1. **Codebase Analysis**
   - Scan relevant directories for each architecture area
   - Identify current patterns and implementations
   - Look for inconsistencies and duplicate code
   - Check against existing standards documents

2. **Issue Identification**
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Performance bottlenecks
   - Consistency problems
   - Missing best practices
   - Code duplication

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update existing `ai/arch/arch-*.md` files
   - Add new patterns discovered
   - Update code examples to match current implementation
   - Add new anti-patterns found
   - Update changelog with recent changes

4. **Jira Integration**
   - Reference Epic SAAS-111 and related tasks
   - Update task status upon completion
   - Log findings in task comments

### Key Directories to Review

- `src/server/api/` - tRPC routers and procedures
- `src/server/auth*.ts` - Authentication configuration
- `src/db/` - Database configuration and schemas
- `src/components/` - UI component library
- `src/app/` - Page implementations and layouts
- `drizzle/` - Database migrations
- Configuration files (tailwind, next.config, etc.)

### Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ All four architecture documents updated with current reality
- ‚úÖ Critical issues identified and logged
- ‚úÖ Clear templates provided for common patterns
- ‚úÖ Anti-patterns documented with examples
- ‚úÖ Changelogs updated with findings
- ‚úÖ Documents serve as definitive guide for developers

### Output Format

Provide a summary of:
1. **Documents Updated** - Which arch docs were refreshed
2. **Critical Issues Found** - High-priority problems discovered
3. **New Patterns Documented** - Fresh implementations added
4. **Compliance Status** - How well current code follows standards
5. **Next Steps** - Recommended actions based on findings

Remember: Focus on documenting the actual implementation, not the intended design. The goal is to make these documents the single source of truth for how the system actually works and how developers should implement new features.

**Note:** This prompt can be run periodically (monthly/quarterly) to keep architecture documentation current with the evolving codebase. It ensures the docs remain useful and accurate for development teams.
