# SAAS-17 Scratchpad: Update ModelFeaturesViewer

## Task Understanding
**SAAS-17**: TS-FE05: Update ModelFeaturesViewer
- **Input**: `model.metrics[0].features` (from metadata root `features` array)
- **Display**: name, original type (`int64`, `object`, `datetime64[ns]`), and encoding
- **Optional**: Link or show coefficient from `global_importance` if names match

This is part of Epic SAAS-1 (Enhanced Model Detail & Inference Capabilities) - specifically **TS-FE05** in the technical implementation plan.

## Requirements from Jira
- Update ModelFeaturesViewer to use enhanced metadata structure
- Show feature name, original data type, and encoding method
- Optionally integrate coefficient information from global_importance
- Leverage the enhanced metadata structure from SAAS-11/12 implementation

## Enhanced Metadata Structure
Based on `docs/model_metadata.json`:
- `features[]` array with: `name`, `original_type`, `encoding`
- `feature_analysis.global_importance[]` with: `feature`, `coefficient`, `abs_coefficient`
- Need to match features by name to link coefficient data

## Analysis Complete ✅
**Current State:**
- ModelFeaturesViewer exists at `src/components/model-features-viewer.tsx`
- Currently uses `model?.metrics[0]?.features?.features` (legacy structure)
- Interface expects: `name`, `type`, `description`, `importance`, `required`, `format`, `range`, `defaultValue`, `tags`
- Has comprehensive filtering, sorting, and search functionality

**Enhanced Metadata Structure:**
- `features[]` has: `name`, `type` (original_type), `description`, `encoding` 
- `feature_analysis.global_importance[]` has: `feature`, `coefficient`, `abs_coefficient`
- Need to map: `type` → `original_type`, add `encoding` column, link coefficients

**Required Changes:**
1. Update interface to match new structure (name, original_type, encoding)
2. Add coefficient display from global_importance
3. Update data source from `features.features` to `features` directly
4. Add encoding column to table
5. Map coefficient data by feature name

## Implementation Complete ✅

**Enhanced ModelFeaturesViewer Component:**
- ✅ Updated interface to accept enhanced metadata structure
- ✅ Added `globalImportance` prop for coefficient linking
- ✅ Created `EnhancedFeature` interface with coefficient and ranking data
- ✅ Added importance ranking system with badges (#1, #2, #3...)
- ✅ Enhanced coefficient display with direction icons (positive/negative/neutral)
- ✅ Added "Original Type" and "Encoding" columns
- ✅ Updated filtering to include encodings (woe, onehot, etc.)
- ✅ Smart sorting with undefined value handling
- ✅ Coefficient formatting with proper sign display

**Updated Models Page Integration:**
- ✅ Updated data source from `features.features` to `features` directly
- ✅ Added `globalImportance` prop passing `feature_analysis.global_importance`
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with fallback arrays

**Key Enhancements:**
- Feature importance ranking with visual badges
- Coefficient direction indicators (TrendingUp/Down/Minus icons)
- Color-coded coefficient values (green positive, red negative)
- Enhanced filtering by data types AND encodings
- Improved search including encoding methods
- Better table layout with truncated descriptions

## Final Results ✅

**SAAS-17 Successfully Completed!**

✅ **Enhanced ModelFeaturesViewer Display:**
- Multi-feature visualization with enhanced metadata structure
- Original data types (int64, object, datetime64[ns]) properly displayed
- Encoding methods (woe, onehot, scaling) with badges
- Feature importance ranking with visual #1, #2, #3 badges
- Coefficient direction visualization (positive/negative/neutral)
- Enhanced filtering by both data types AND encoding methods

✅ **Technical Implementation:**
- Updated `ModelFeaturesViewer` component interface
- Added `globalImportance` prop for coefficient linking
- Enhanced with TypeScript safety and proper types
- Smart sorting with undefined value handling
- Color-coded impact indicators
- Improved search functionality including encodings

✅ **Models Page Integration:**
- Updated data source from legacy `features.features` to `features`
- Added `globalImportance` prop with `feature_analysis.global_importance` 
- Maintained backward compatibility with fallback arrays
- Preserves existing functionality while adding enhancements

✅ **Quality Assurance:**
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ No errors
- Linting: ✅ No errors  
- Development server: ✅ Running successfully
- Component architecture: ✅ Follows established patterns
