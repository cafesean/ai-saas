🚨 NEW: tRPC Architecture Epic & Subtasks
Epic: SAAS-121: Fix tRPC Architecture Issues
Main task organizing all tRPC improvements
Critical Security Subtasks:
SAAS-122: Fix Hardcoded Tenant IDs
Priority: 🚨 HIGHEST (Security Vulnerability)
Impact: Multi-tenant data isolation broken
Files: rule-set.router.ts, lookup-table.router.ts, variable.router.ts
SAAS-123: Implement Rate Limiting
Priority: ⚠️ HIGH (DoS Protection)
Impact: Only admin operations currently protected
Scope: All tRPC mutations need rate limiting
High Priority Maintenance Subtasks:
SAAS-124: Split Workflow Router (1047 lines)
Priority: ⚠️ HIGH (Maintainability)
Impact: Largest file in codebase, hard to maintain
Solution: Split into 4 focused routers
SAAS-125: Consolidate Lookup Table Duplicates
Priority: ⚠️ HIGH (Code Duplication)
Impact: 3 different implementations cause confusion
Files: lookup-table.router.ts, lookupTable.router.ts, new-lookup-table.ts
Medium Priority Enhancement Subtasks:
SAAS-126: Standardize File Naming
Priority: 📋 MEDIUM (Code Organization)
Impact: Inconsistent .router.ts naming conventions
Files: lookupTable.router.ts, new-lookup-table.ts, n8n.ts
SAAS-127: Enhance Input Validation
Priority: 📋 MEDIUM (Security Enhancement)
Impact: Comprehensive validation and sanitization needed
Scope: All router input validation patterns
📊 Implementation Priority Order
🚨 Phase 1: Critical Security (Immediate)
Fix hardcoded tenant IDs (SAAS-122) - Security vulnerability
Implement rate limiting (SAAS-123) - DoS protection
⚠️ Phase 2: High Impact Maintenance
Split workflow router (SAAS-124) - Developer productivity
Consolidate lookup tables (SAAS-125) - Eliminate confusion
📋 Phase 3: Code Quality & Standards
Standardize file naming (SAAS-126) - Team consistency
Enhance input validation (SAAS-127) - Data integrity
Complete error handling standards (SAAS-120) - API consistency
🎯 Total Impact
7 new tickets created for comprehensive tRPC architecture improvements
4 existing tickets updated with completion status
Clear priority order from critical security to code quality
Detailed implementation guidance for each issue
Comprehensive coverage of all architecture issues identified
The team now has a complete roadmap for addressing both the completed data access layer work and the identified tRPC architecture improvements! 🚀
