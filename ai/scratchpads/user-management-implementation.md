# User Management Module Implementation

## Epic Overview
**Epic SAAS-69**: User Management Module - Complete CRUD and administration functionality for enterprise-scale user management.

## Current Task
Moving to **SAAS-71: Create User Dialog and Functionality**

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: User Data Table Foundation (SAAS-70) âœ… COMPLETE
- [X] Review existing role table patterns for consistency
- [X] Set up user data types and schemas
- [X] Create basic user table component structure
- [X] Implement core table functionality with TanStack Table
- [X] Add search and filtering capabilities
- [X] Implement advanced features (export, bulk selection, etc.)

### Phase 2: User CRUD Operations (SAAS-71, SAAS-72) ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Create user dialog implementation
- [ ] Form validation with Zod schemas
- [ ] Password generation and handling
- [ ] Role assignment during creation
- [ ] Edit user dialog implementation
- [ ] Form validation and API integration

### Phase 3: Role Management Integration (SAAS-73)
- [ ] User role assignment interface
- [ ] Permission preview functionality

### Phase 4: Bulk Operations (SAAS-74)
- [ ] Bulk user operations implementation
- [ ] Progress tracking and confirmation dialogs

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation (SAAS-75)
- [ ] Comprehensive testing suite
- [ ] Performance validation

## Technical Approach
Following existing patterns from role management implementation:
- Use TanStack Table for advanced table functionality
- Follow existing UI patterns and components
- Integrate with tRPC APIs
- Maintain RBAC integration
- Use existing form validation patterns

## Next Steps - SAAS-71 Implementation
1. Create CreateUserDialog component
2. Implement form validation with Zod
3. Add password generation functionality
4. Integrate with user.create API
5. Add role assignment during creation
6. Test create functionality

## Progress Log
- [X] Created implementation plan
- [X] Started SAAS-70 implementation
- [X] Created user types and interfaces
- [X] Created user router with comprehensive CRUD operations
- [X] Added user router to main tRPC router
- [X] Created user table columns hook
- [X] Created UserDataTable component with advanced features
- [X] Created main users page with basic functionality
- [X] Fixed TypeScript and import issues
- [X] SAAS-70 Foundation Complete âœ…
- [ ] Starting SAAS-71: Create User Dialog

## SAAS-70 Status: FOUNDATION COMPLETE âœ…

### What's Been Implemented:
1. **User Types & Interfaces** (`src/types/user.ts`)
   - Complete user data types with stats
   - Form data interfaces
   - Filter and bulk action types

   - Full CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
   - Advanced filtering and pagination
   - Bulk operations (activate, deactivate, delete)
   - Role assignment/removal functionality
   - Comprehensive error handling

3. **User Table Components**
   - **UserDataTable** with all advanced features from role table:
     - Row selection and bulk operations
     - Export functionality (CSV/JSON)
     - Advanced filtering and search
     - Column visibility controls
     - Table density controls
     - Pagination
   - **useUserTableColumns** hook with rich column definitions:
