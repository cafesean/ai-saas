# User Management Module Implementation

## Epic Overview
**Epic SAAS-69**: User Management Module - Complete CRUD and administration functionality for enterprise-scale user management.

## Current Status: COMPLETE ✅ - WITH CRITICAL FIXES & UX IMPROVEMENTS

### Recent Fixes Applied (Password & Update Issues):

**Issues Identified:**
1. **Password Input Issue**: Users couldn't type in password field due to complex value/onChange setup
2. **Update Not Working**: User update functionality was failing
3. **Password Always Required**: Password was required even in edit mode
4. **No Separate Password Change**: Password changes should be a separate action
5. **Tenant Foreign Key Constraint**: Role assignments failed due to non-existent tenant IDs
6. **Password Toggle UX**: Toggle was confusing, needed button with confirm/cancel
7. **Missing Organization Selector**: No way to select organization in basic info
8. **onOpenChange Error**: Component prop mismatch causing runtime errors
9. **500 Error on Update**: organizationId field being sent to API but not in schema

**Fixes Applied:**
1. **Fixed Password Input**: 
   - Removed complex value/onChange override that prevented typing
   - Simplified password field to use standard form registration
   - Fixed password generation to work properly with form

2. **Fixed User Update API**: 
   - Corrected email uniqueness check in API (was using wrong condition)
   - Added proper `not()` import from drizzle-orm
   - Fixed form submission to handle password updates correctly

3. **Dynamic Password Validation**: 
   - Created dynamic form schema that makes password required only when needed
   - Password required in create mode or when changing password in edit mode
   - Proper validation messages for different scenarios

4. **Improved Password Change UX**: 
   - **CHANGED**: Replaced toggle with "Change Password" button
   - **ADDED**: Password input appears with confirm (✓) and cancel (✗) buttons
   - **IMPROVED**: Clear visual feedback for password editing state
   - **ENHANCED**: Better user flow for password changes

5. **Fixed Tenant Foreign Key Constraint**: 
   - Created tenant router with proper API endpoints
   - Added tenant seeding functionality to ensure default tenant exists
   - Updated form to use real tenant data instead of mock data
   - Added organization selector to basic info tab

6. **Added Organization Selector**: 
   - **NEW**: Organization dropdown in Basic Info tab
   - **INTEGRATED**: Uses real tenant data from API
   - **REQUIRED**: Organization selection is mandatory for all users
   - **VISUAL**: Building icon for better UX

7. **Fixed Component Props**: 
   - **FIXED**: Changed `onClose` to `onOpenChange` in UserFormDialog usage
   - **RESOLVED**: "onOpenChange is not a function" runtime error
   - **IMPROVED**: Proper dialog state management

8. **Fixed 500 Error on User Update**: 
   - **IDENTIFIED**: Form was sending `organizationId` field not in user schema
   - **FIXED**: Excluded `organizationId` from create/update API calls
   - **RESOLVED**: User updates now work without 500 errors
   - **CLARIFIED**: Organization is handled through role assignments, not user fields

### UX Improvements Made:

- ✅ Proper form validation for password requirements

**Organization Management:**
