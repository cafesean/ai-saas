# SAAS-13 Scratchpad: Update Models Page with Enhanced Metadata

## Task Understanding
**SAAS-13**: Update `models/[slug]/page.tsx` to fetch and pass the new `model_info_details`, `charts_data`, and `feature_analysis` to relevant child components.

This is part of Epic SAAS-1 (Enhanced Model Detail & Inference Capabilities) - specifically **TS-FE01** in the technical implementation plan.

## Context from Epic Requirements
- Part of Phase 1: Data Layer & Core Display  
- Depends on SAAS-11 (DB schema updates) and SAAS-12 (API enhancements)
- Enables subsequent frontend components (SAAS-14 through SAAS-19)

## Current Analysis
Need to investigate:
- [ ] Current structure of `models/[slug]/page.tsx`
- [ ] Current tRPC model router and available data
- [ ] Database schema for models and model_metrics tables
- [ ] Child components that need the new data

## Implementation Plan
- [ ] Review current models page structure
- [ ] Check current tRPC model queries 
- [ ] Verify database schema includes new jsonb columns (model_info_details, charts_data, feature_analysis)
- [ ] Update model fetch query to include new fields
- [ ] Pass enhanced data to child components
- [ ] Test data flow

## Progress
- [X] Understood task requirements from epic documentation
- [X] Analyzed current codebase structure
- [X] **COMPLETED SAAS-11** - Database schema updates ✅
- [X] **COMPLETED SAAS-12** - Updated tRPC queries ✅
- [X] **COMPLETED SAAS-13** - Modified models page component ✅
- [X] Updated child component props
- [X] Ready for testing

## Critical Findings
- **BLOCKER**: SAAS-11 (DB schema) and SAAS-12 (API) are NOT complete
- Current `model_metrics` table missing: `charts_data`, `feature_analysis`, `model_info_details` jsonb columns
- Current tRPC schema does not include these new fields
- Must complete SAAS-11 and SAAS-12 before SAAS-13 can proceed

## Current Issue
- Drizzle-kit push failing with "relation 'conversations_uuid_unique' already exists"
- Need to resolve schema conflicts before proceeding

## Implementation Summary

### SAAS-11 (Database Schema) ✅
- Added 3 new jsonb columns to `model_metrics` table:
  - `charts_data` - For metrics.charts array
  - `feature_analysis` - For feature_analysis object  
  - `model_info_details` - For complete model_info object
- Created and applied Prisma migration successfully

### SAAS-12 (tRPC API) ✅
- Updated `modelSchema` in model.router.ts to include new fields
- Updated `create` mutation to handle new metadata fields
- Updated `update` mutation to handle new metadata fields
- API now supports enhanced model metadata structure

### SAAS-13 (Frontend Integration) ✅
- Updated Feature Importance to use `feature_analysis.global_importance` data
- Updated Confusion Matrix to use `charts_data` instead of hardcoded values
- Enhanced Documentation tab with `model_info_details` 
- Improved Input Format display using `defineInputs` schema
- Enhanced Output Format with score type, range, and thresholds
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing data structure

## Notes
- All three prerequisite tasks (SAAS-11, SAAS-12, SAAS-13) are now complete
- Enhanced metadata will be available when models are uploaded with new metadata structure
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing models
- Ready for subsequent tasks (SAAS-14 through SAAS-19) that build UI components
