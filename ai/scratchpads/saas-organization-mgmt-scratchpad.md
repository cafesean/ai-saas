# SAAS Organization Management Module Implementation Plan

## **Task Overview**
Build an Organization Management module following the existing patterns established in the Role Management implementation (SAAS-29). Each user can be associated with one or more organizations (tenants), with organizations serving as the primary tenant boundary.

## **Current System Analysis**

### **Existing Database Structure** ✅
The system already has a solid foundation:
- `tenants` table (organizations) with proper indexing and constraints
- `userTenants` table (user-organization relationships) 
- `userRoles` table linking users, tenants, and roles
- Full RBAC system with tenant-scoped permissions

### **Patterns to Follow** 📋
Based on the successful SAAS-29 Role Management implementation:
- TanStack Table with sorting, filtering, pagination
- Modal-based CRUD operations (Create/Edit/Delete dialogs)
- tRPC routers with Zod validation
- Permission-gated operations
- Responsive design with loading states
- Bulk operations and advanced table features

### **Reference Implementation from Another Codebase** 📖
The provided org-code.txt shows:
- Organization verification workflow
- Multi-tenant user assignment patterns
- Role-based organization access
- File upload capabilities
- Business information management

## **Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Core Table Implementation**
1. **Organization Types & Interfaces**
   - Create comprehensive TypeScript types
   - Define organization status enums
   - Create table column definitions

2. **Organization Table Component**
   - Implement TanStack Table with full features
   - Add sorting, filtering, pagination
   - Include organization statistics (users count, active status)
   - Responsive design with mobile support

3. **Organization tRPC Router**
   - CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
   - Bulk operations support
   - User assignment management
   - Statistics and aggregation queries

### **Phase 2: CRUD Operations**
4. **Create Organization Dialog**
   - Form validation with Zod schema
   - Business information fields
   - Logo upload capability
   - User assignment interface

5. **Edit Organization Dialog**
   - Pre-populated form
   - System organization protection
   - Change tracking
   - Update validation

6. **Delete Organization Confirmation**
   - Impact assessment (users, data affected)
   - Soft delete implementation
   - Cascade handling
   - Confirmation with detailed warnings

### **Phase 3: User Management**
7. **User Assignment Management**
   - Add/remove users from organizations
   - Role assignment within organizations
   - Bulk user operations
   - User invitation system

8. **Organization Switching**
   - User context switching between orgs
   - Permission updates on switch
   - UI state management
   - Navigation updates

### **Phase 4: Advanced Features**
9. **Organization Settings**
   - Business information management
   - Branding and customization
   - Feature toggles
   - Integration settings

10. **Advanced Table Features**
    - Row selection with bulk operations
    - Export functionality (CSV, JSON)
    - Advanced filtering
    - Column visibility controls

## **Technical Specifications**

### **Database Schema** (Already Implemented) ✅
```sql
-- tenants table structure
- id: serial primary key
- uuid: unique identifier
- name: organization name
- description: optional description
- slug: unique slug for URLs
- logoUrl: logo file URL
- website: company website
- businessAddress: physical address
- isActive: soft delete flag
- createdAt/updatedAt: timestamps

-- userTenants relationship
- userId/tenantId: composite primary key
- role: temporary role field
- isActive: relationship status
- timestamps
```

### **Permission Structure**
Following the existing RBAC pattern:
- `organization:create` - Create new organizations
- `organization:read` - View organization details
- `organization:update` - Edit organization information
- `organization:delete` - Delete organizations
- `organization:manage_users` - Assign/remove users
- `organization:admin` - Full organization administration

## **Implementation Steps**

### **Step 1: Setup Foundation** 🏗️
- [ ] Create organization types and interfaces
- [ ] Set up tRPC router with basic CRUD
- [ ] Create table column definitions
- [ ] Implement basic page structure

### **Step 2: Core Table** 📊
- [ ] Implement OrganizationDataTable component
- [ ] Add sorting, filtering, pagination
- [ ] Include organization statistics
- [ ] Add loading states and skeletons

### **Step 3: CRUD Dialogs** 📝
- [ ] Create organization dialog with form validation
- [ ] Edit organization dialog with pre-population
- [ ] Delete confirmation with impact assessment
- [ ] Error handling and success notifications

### **Step 4: User Management** 👥
- [ ] User assignment interface
- [ ] Role management within organizations
- [ ] Bulk user operations
- [ ] User invitation system

### **Step 5: Advanced Features** ⚡
- [ ] Bulk organization operations
- [ ] Export functionality

## **Key Design Decisions**

### **Multi-Tenancy Approach** 🏢
- Organizations are the primary tenant boundary
- Users can belong to multiple organizations
- Roles are scoped to specific organizations
- Data isolation enforced at the organization level
