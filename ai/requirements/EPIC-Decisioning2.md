## **Decision Engine: Final Implementation Plan (v2 with Matrix Lookups)**

### **1. Introduction & Guiding Principles**

This document provides the complete, Jira-ready set of epics and stories required to implement the **Decision Engine** feature. It is structured to be directly translatable into a project management tool.

*   **Architectural Standard:** All tables will use `id BIGSERIAL` for internal joins and a `uuid` for external API exposure, enforced by a single migration.
*   **Security First:** Multi-tenancy is enforced at the database layer with RLS. All API endpoints are protected with RBAC middleware.
*   **Incremental Development:** Foundational work (DB, RBAC) precedes feature work. Large features are broken into smaller, verifiable tasks.
*   **Risk Mitigation:** The plan actively incorporates solutions to previously identified issues like schema mismatches, API inconsistencies, and incomplete dependency setups.

### **2. Foundational Epics (Architectural & Security Prerequisites)**

#### **Epic: DB & Security Foundation (DB-SEC-01)**
**Goal:** To establish a secure, multi-tenant database foundation for all Decision Engine artifacts, fully compliant with platform standards.

*   **Story: Initial Decision Engine Migration (TS-DB-01)**
    *   **Title:** Create and Apply Consolidated Database Migration for Decision Engine
    *   **Description:** As a developer, I need to create a single, comprehensive Drizzle migration that defines all necessary tables for the Decision Engine, ensuring they adhere to the platform's multi-tenancy and primary key standards.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        1.  A single Drizzle migration file is generated for `variables`, `decision_tables` (and its children), `lookup_tables` (and its new matrix children), `rule_sets`, and `test_scenarios`.
        2.  All new tables use `id BIGSERIAL` as the `PRIMARY KEY` and a `uuid` column (`UNIQUE NOT NULL`) for external exposure.
        3.  All tables include a non-nullable `tenant_id` column for data isolation.
        4.  Core artifact tables include a composite `UNIQUE` index on `(tenant_id, name)` to prevent duplicates.
        5.  The migration applies and reverts cleanly.
        6.  RLS is enabled via migration for all tables containing a `tenant_id`.
        7.  A security policy is created that permits access only when a row's `tenant_id` matches the `app.tenant_id` session variable.
        8.  An automated test confirms that a user from one tenant cannot access data from another.
    *   **Dependencies:** `SEC-MIGRATE-01` (from RBAC epic).
    *   **Relative Effort:** L
    *   **Key Files:** `src/db/schema/variable.ts`, `src/db/schema/decisionTable.ts`, etc., and a new Drizzle migration file.

*   **Story: Implement Row-Level Security (TS-DE-02)**
    *   **Title:** Apply Database Row-Level Security Policies to All Decision Engine Tables
    *   **Description:** As a developer, I need to implement and enable PostgreSQL RLS policies on all multi-tenant tables to create a hard security boundary at the database layer.
    *   **Dependencies:** `TS-DE-01`.
        1.  RLS is enabled via migration for all tables containing a `tenant_id`.
        2.  A security policy is created that permits access only when a row's `tenant_id` matches the `app.tenant_id` session variable.
        3.  An automated test confirms that a user from one tenant cannot access data from another.
    *   **Dependencies:** `TS-DB-01`.
    *   **Relative Effort:** L

#### **Epic: RBAC for Decision Engine (SEC-RBAC-01)**
**Goal:** To secure all Decision Engine endpoints and actions with granular, role-based access control.

*   **Story: Define and Implement Permission Slugs (TS-DE-03)**
    *   **Title:** Define and Implement RBAC Permissions for the Decision Engine
    *   **Description:** As a developer, I need to define all the necessary permission slugs for the Decision Engine and ensure they are checked in the tRPC middleware.
    *   **Dependencies:** `DE-DB-SEC-01`, `SEC-API-01` (from RBAC epic).
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        1.  A constant file (`src/constants/permissions.ts`) is updated with new slugs like `decisioning:variable_create`, `decisioning:table_publish`, etc.
        2.  All new tRPC mutations in the Decision Engine routers are protected by the `hasPermission(...)` middleware using these new slugs.
    *   **Dependencies:** `DB-SEC-01`.

#### **Epic: Quality Assurance for Decision Engine (QA-TEST-01)**
**Goal:** To establish a robust testing strategy that ensures the reliability and correctness of the Decision Engine's complex logic.


*   **Story: Unit & E2E Test Setup (TS-QA-01)**
    *   **Title:** Configure Vitest and Playwright and Implement Initial Tests
    *   **Description:** As a developer, I need to set up the testing frameworks and write initial unit tests for critical logic and a "happy path" E2E test to validate the core user journey.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        1.  Vitest is configured; unit tests for the n8n code-generation helpers are written and achieve >90% coverage.
        2.  Playwright is configured.
        3.  An E2E test exists that validates the creation, publishing, and successful testing of a simple Decision Table via the Test Console.
    *   **Dependencies:** `US-DE-08` (for the Test Console UI needed by the E2E test).
    *   **Relative Effort:** L
