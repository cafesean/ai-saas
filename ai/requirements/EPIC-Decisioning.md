Of course. Based on the detailed requirements and leveraging the best practices from our previous planning sessions (like explicit dependencies, separating foundational epics, and slicing stories), here is the complete, Jira-ready plan for the Decision Engine.

---
## **Decision Engine: Complete Epics, User Stories, and Technical Stories**

### **1. Introduction**

This document provides a full breakdown of the work required to implement the **Decision Engine** feature. The plan is structured with foundational epics (addressing architecture, security, and testing) followed by feature-focused epics that build upon each other. Each story includes explicit dependencies, a relative effort estimate, and key file pointers to make it actionable for development teams.

*   **Relative Effort Guide:**
    *   **S (Small):** A small, well-defined task. ~1-2 days.
    *   **M (Medium):** A standard story with some complexity. ~3-5 days.
    *   **L (Large):** A complex story with multiple parts. ~5-8 days.

### **2. Foundational Epics (Architectural & Security Prerequisites)**

#### **Epic: DB & Security Foundation (DB-SEC-01)**
**Goal:** To establish a secure, multi-tenant database foundation for all Decision Engine artifacts.

*   **Story: Initial Decision Engine Migration (TS-DB-01)**
    *   **Title:** Create and Apply Consolidated Database Migration for Decision Engine
    *   **Description:** As a developer, I need to create a single, comprehensive Drizzle migration that defines all necessary tables for the Decision Engine, ensuring they adhere to the platform's multi-tenancy and primary key standards.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        1.  A single Drizzle migration file is generated for `variables`, `lookup_tables`, `decision_tables` (and its children), `rule_sets`, and `test_scenarios` tables.
        2.  All new tables use a `uuid` column (with `default gen_random_uuid()`) as the primary key.
        3.  All tables include a `tenant_id` column for data isolation and a composite unique index on `(tenant_id, name)` where applicable.
        4.  Versioning (`version`) and lifecycle (`status`) columns are included on all core artifact tables.
        5.  The migration applies and reverts cleanly.
    *   **Dependencies:** None.
    *   **Relative Effort:** L
    *   **Key Files:** `src/db/schema/variable.ts`, `src/db/schema/decisionTable.ts`, etc., and a new Drizzle migration file.

*   **Story: Implement Row-Level Security (TS-DB-02)**
    *   **Title:** Apply Database Row-Level Security Policies to All Decision Engine Tables
    *   **Description:** As a developer, I need to implement and enable PostgreSQL RLS policies on all multi-tenant tables to create a hard security boundary at the database layer.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        1.  RLS is enabled via migration for all tables containing a `tenant_id`.
        2.  A security policy is created that permits access only when a row's `tenant_id` matches the `app.tenant_id` session variable.
        3.  An automated test confirms that a user from one tenant cannot access data from another.
    *   **Dependencies:** `TS-DB-01`.
    *   **Relative Effort:** L

#### **Epic: RBAC for Decision Engine (SEC-RBAC-01)**
**Goal:** To secure all Decision Engine endpoints and actions with granular, role-based access control.

*   **Story: Define and Implement Permission Slugs (TS-RBAC-01)**
    *   **Title:** Define and Implement RBAC Permissions for the Decision Engine
    *   **Description:** As a developer, I need to define all the necessary permission slugs for the Decision Engine and ensure they are checked in the tRPC middleware.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        1.  A constant file (`src/constants/permissions.ts`) is updated with new slugs like `decisioning:variable:create`, `decisioning:table:publish`, etc.
        2.  All new tRPC mutations in the Decision Engine routers are protected by the `hasPermission(...)` middleware using these new slugs.
    *   **Dependencies:** `DB-SEC-01`.
    *   **Relative Effort:** M

#### **Epic: Quality Assurance for Decision Engine (QA-TEST-01)**
**Goal:** To establish a robust testing strategy that ensures the reliability and correctness of the Decision Engine's complex logic.

*   **Story: Unit & E2E Test Setup (TS-QA-01)**
    *   **Title:** Configure Vitest and Playwright and Implement Initial Tests
    *   **Description:** As a developer, I need to set up the testing frameworks and write initial unit tests for critical logic and a "happy path" E2E test to validate the core user journey.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        1.  Vitest is configured; unit tests for the n8n code-generation helpers are written and achieve >90% coverage.
        2.  Playwright is configured.
        3.  An E2E test exists that validates the creation, publishing, and successful testing of a simple Decision Table via the Test Console.
    *   **Dependencies:** `US-DE-08` (for the Test Console UI needed by the E2E test).
    *   **Relative Effort:** L

### **3. Feature Epics**

        1.  Every "Publish" action creates a new, immutable version of an artifact.
        2.  The UI displays a version history for each artifact.
        3.  A user can select two versions and see a "diff" of the changes.
        4.  A user can choose a previous version and click "Revert," which creates a new draft identical to that older version.
    *   **Dependencies:** `US-DE-01`, `US-DE-02`, `US-DE-03`.
    *   **Relative Effort:** L

#### **Epic: Workflow & Node Integration (DE-EPIC-02)**

        1.  "Decision Table," "Lookup Table," and "Rule Set" appear as options in the "Add Node" palette.
        2.  When a node is added, its properties panel has a dropdown to select a *published* artifact.
        3.  Once an artifact is selected, the node on the canvas visually updates to show the correct input and output ports based on the artifact's schema.

    *   **Tasks:**
        *   **Backend Schema Hydration (TS-DE-05):** In `workflow.router.ts`, implement logic to fetch the schema (inputs/outputs) for each decision node in a workflow and inject it into the `node.data` object returned to the client. Implement caching to prevent N+1 queries. (Effort: M)
        *   **Backend n8n Code Generation (TS-DE-06):** In `workflow.router.ts`, implement the JavaScript code generation for `Decision Table`, `Lookup Table`, and `Rule Set` nodes. Ensure this logic is covered by the unit tests from `TS-QA-01`. (Effort: L)

        1.  A "Test" button on each artifact's editor page opens the Test Console dialog.
        2.  The dialog dynamically displays input fields based on the artifact's schema.
        3.  Clicking "Run" executes the logic on the server (without n8n) and displays the output.
        4.  A user can save the current input values as a named "Test Scenario."
        5.  A user can load a previously saved scenario from a dropdown to pre-fill the form.
    *   **Dependencies:** `DE-EPIC-01`.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   **Backend (TS-DE-09-BE):** Implement `testing.router.ts` with an in-memory `runTest` mutation and `saveScenario`/`getScenarios` procedures that interact with the `test_scenarios` table. (Effort: L)

    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        1.  A shared `auditLog(action, entity, ctx)` utility is created.
        2.  Audit logs are generated and stored for the following actions: `PUBLISH`, `DEPRECATE`, `REVERT` of any artifact.
        3.  An audit log is generated for every execution via the Test Console (`TEST_RUN`).
    *   **Dependencies:** `DB-SEC-01`, `DE-EPIC-01`, `US-DE-07`.
