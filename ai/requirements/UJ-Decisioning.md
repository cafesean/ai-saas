Of course. Here is a detailed user journey for the Lookup Table module, following a Business Analyst persona named Anna from the initial requirement to the final implementation and maintenance of the artifact.

### **User Journey: Creating and Using a Lookup Table**

**Persona:** Anna, a Business Analyst. She is responsible for translating business policies into rules within the AI SaaS Platform. She is not a developer but is comfortable with structured data and logical flows.

**Goal:** Anna needs to implement a new policy that maps a customer's country of residence to a specific numerical risk weight. This is a simple, one-to-one mapping.

---

#### **Part 1: The Requirement & Initial Creation**

1.  **The Business Need:**
    *   Anna receives a new policy document. It states:
        *   USA -> Risk Weight: 0.1
        *   CAN -> Risk Weight: 0.2
        *   MEX -> Risk Weight: 0.3
        *   All other countries -> Risk Weight: 0.5 (Default)
    *   She recognizes this doesn't require complex multi-condition logic, making it a perfect candidate for a **Lookup Table** rather than a full Decision Table.

2.  **Navigating to the Module:**
    *   Anna logs into the AI SaaS Platform. In the main navigation sidebar, she clicks on the **"Decisioning"** section.
    *   This takes her to the Decisioning module's main page. She sees two prominent tabs: "Decision Tables" and **"Lookup Tables"**.
    *   She clicks the **"Lookup Tables"** tab. The view updates to show a list of existing lookup tables, along with their status and last updated date.

3.  **Creating the New Lookup Table:**
    *   Anna clicks the **"+ New Lookup Table"** button in the top right corner.
    *   A **"Create New Lookup Table"** dialog appears. It has three fields:
        1.  **Name:** She enters `Country to Risk Weighting`.
        2.  **Description:** She enters `Maps ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country codes to internal risk weights per Q3 policy v1.1.`.
        3.  **Tags (Optional):** She adds the tags `Risk`, `Onboarding`.
    *   She clicks the **"Create Table"** button.

#### **Part 2: Authoring and Configuration**

4.  **The Editor Interface:**
    *   Anna is automatically redirected to the editor page for her new `Country to Risk Weighting` table.
    *   A badge at the top of the page clearly indicates the status: **"Draft"**.
    *   The page is divided into three main sections:
        1.  **Input (Left Panel):** To define what the table looks up.
        2.  **Output (Left Panel):** To define what the table returns.
        3.  **Table Grid (Main Area):** To enter the actual mapping data.

5.  **Configuring the Input:**
    *   The "Input" panel prompts her to `Select an input variable`.
    *   She clicks the dropdown. It shows a searchable list of all *published* variables in the central **Variable Library**.
    *   She types "country" and selects the existing `applicant_country_code` variable, which is of type `Text`.
    *   The panel updates to show **Input: `applicant_country_code` (Text)**.

6.  **Configuring the Output:**
    *   The "Output" panel prompts her to `Define the output variable`.
    *   She fills in two fields:
        1.  **Output Name:** `country_risk_weight`.
        2.  **Data Type:** She selects `Numeric` from a dropdown.
    *   The panel updates to show **Output: `country_risk_weight` (Numeric)**.

7.  **Populating the Table Grid:**
    *   The main table grid has now updated with two columns: `applicant_country_code (Input)` and `country_risk_weight (Output)`.
    *   She clicks the **"+ Add Row"** button three times.
    *   She fills out the rows one by one in the editable grid:
        *   Row 1: `USA` | `0.1`
        *   Row 2: `CAN` | `0.2`
        *   Row 3: `MEX` | `0.3`
    *   The system provides real-time validation. If she were to type "abc" in the `country_risk_weight` (Numeric) column, the cell border would turn red with a tooltip saying "Invalid input. Expected a number."

8.  **Adding the Default/Catch-All Row:**
    *   Anna needs to handle all other countries. Below the main grid, she clicks the **"Add Default Row"** button.
    *   A special, non-deletable row appears at the bottom of the table. The input cell is read-only and displays **"Any other value"**.
    *   She clicks into the output cell for this row and enters `0.5`.
    *   She clicks the **"Save Draft"** button. A toast notification confirms: "Draft saved successfully."

#### **Part 3: Testing and Publishing**

9.  **Testing the Logic:**
    *   Anna clicks the **"Test"** button in the page header.
    *   The **"Test Console"** dialog slides open. It automatically displays one input field labeled `applicant_country_code`.
    *   **Test Case 1 (Standard Match):** She enters `USA` into the input field and clicks **"Run Test"**.
        *   The output section immediately displays the result: `{ "country_risk_weight": 0.1 }`.
    *   **Test Case 2 (Default Match):** She enters `GBR` and clicks **"Run Test"**.
        *   The output section displays the default result: `{ "country_risk_weight": 0.5 }`.
    *   **Test Case 3 (Save Scenario):** She wants to save this default case for future regression testing. She clicks **"Save as Scenario"**, names it `Unlisted European Country`, and saves it.
    *   Satisfied, she closes the Test Console.

10. **Publishing the Artifact:**
    *   Anna clicks the **"Publish"** button.
    *   A confirmation modal appears: "Are you sure you want to publish version 1 of 'Country to Risk Weighting'? Once published, this version cannot be edited. It will become available for use in all workflows."
    *   She clicks **"Publish"**.
    *   The page updates. The status badge now reads **"Published - v1"**. All editing controls on the page are now disabled, making it clear this is a read-only, active artifact.

#### **Part 4: Usage and Maintenance**

11. **Usage in a Workflow:**
    *   Later that day, a colleague building a new "Applicant Onboarding" workflow needs to use Anna's logic.
    *   In the workflow editor, they drag a **"Lookup Table"** node onto the canvas.
    *   In the node's properties panel, they click the "Select Lookup Table" dropdown. Anna's `Country to Risk Weighting` table appears in the list.
    *   They select it. The node on the canvas instantly updates, showing an input port for `applicant_country_code` and an output port for `country_risk_weight`.

12. **Maintenance (Creating a New Version):**
    *   Two months later, the risk policy changes: Canada's risk weight is now 0.25.
    *   Anna navigates back to her published `Country to Risk Weighting` table.
    *   She clicks the **"Create New Draft"** button.
    *   The system creates a new, editable copy and the status badge changes to **"Draft - v2"**. All the data from v1 is pre-populated.
    *   She finds the `CAN` row and changes the output value from `0.2` to `0.25`.
    *   She saves, runs her tests (including the saved "Unlisted European Country" scenario to check for regressions), and **publishes v2**.
    *   The system now holds two published versions. Existing workflows continue to use v1 uninterrupted. The colleague who built the onboarding workflow gets a notification or sees a flag on their workflow node indicating that a newer version of the lookup table is available, which they can choose to adopt at their convenience.
