# AI SaaS Platform: Solution Architecture Overview

## 1. Solution Architecture

The AI SaaS Platform employs a robust and flexible microservices-oriented architecture designed for lending intelligence applications, encompassing risk decisioning, scoring, and process automation. The architecture supports various deployment models, including standard SaaS on cloud infrastructure (utilizing containerization technologies like Kubernetes) and on-premise or hybrid deployments to meet specific client requirements such as data residency and regulatory compliance.

Key architectural components include:

*   **AI Model Management & Execution:** Centralizes the lifecycle management and operation of diverse AI models.
*   **Workflow Automation Engine:** Orchestrates complex business processes through configurable nodes and triggers.
*   **Decision Engine (Rules Management):** Executes business logic defined in configurable decision tables.
*   **Integration Framework & APIs:** Provides secure interfaces for interaction with internal modules and external systems.
*   **Data Storage Layer:** Utilizes appropriate storage mechanisms, including relational databases (PostgreSQL) and Vector Databases for RAG.
*   **Agent System (RAG-based):** Enables knowledge retrieval and generation using LLMs and vectorized knowledge bases.
*   **User Experience Layer & Embeddable Web Widgets:** Facilitates user interaction and delivers contextual information within client applications via embeddable components.
*   **Reporting, Monitoring & Analytics Systems:** Offers operational visibility, model performance tracking, AI-driven reporting, and compliance auditing.
*   **Administration & Security Module:** Manages platform access, permissions, multi-tenancy, and security configurations.

These components are interconnected via defined data flows and utilize dedicated integration layers for secure communication with external entities (such as client systems, credit bureaus, data providers).

## 2. Core Platform Components & Features

The AI SaaS Platform is composed of the following integrated modules:

### 2.1 Model Management Features

*   **Model Hub:** Serves as a central point for integrating various AI model types (custom-built, third-party, LLMs, open-source).
*   **Model Repository & Version Control:** Provides secure storage (AWS S3) and version management for imported models and associated artifacts (configurations, dependencies), adhering to defined data governance policies.
*   **Import Functionality:** Supports the import of pre-built model artifacts (e.g., `.pkl`, `.h5`) and associated metadata JSON files.
*   **Fine-Tuning Capability:** Allows fine-tuning of compatible models when appropriate weights and information are available.
*   **Champion/Challenger Groups:** Enables the configuration and execution of multiple models (champion vs. challengers) concurrently for A/B testing and performance comparison on live inference requests.
*   **Model Training Pipeline Configuration:** Facilitates the configuration (such as data splits) and automated execution of imported training pipelines for model retraining or rebuilding cycles. (Note: Initial base model training occurs off-platform).
*   **Model Detail View:** Displays key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics (such as Accuracy, AUC-ROC, Gini) derived from the model's training and validation phases, along with relevant charts (such as ROC curves) and visuals (like confusion matrices).
*   **Consolidated Inference Logging:** Offers a dedicated interface for viewing and analyzing inference logs across all deployed models.
*   **Model Types Supported:** Manages Custom Client Models, platform-provided Preset Models (trainable on client data), and various application-specific model types.
*   **Explainable AI (XAI) Integration:** Incorporates features to provide transparency into model predictions (for instance, utilizing methods like SHAP or LIME for feature importance) and supports bias detection analysis capabilities.

### 2.2 Workflow Automation Engine

*   **Graphical Workflow Design:** Provides a visual drag-and-drop interface (ReactFlow) for designing, configuring, and connecting various functional nodes to automate business processes.
*   **Trigger Nodes:** Supports workflow initiation via Webhooks (external API calls), Scheduled Triggers (time-based execution), or Application Triggers (based on events from integrated external systems).
*   **Node Library:** Offers a range of node types including Model execution, Rule application (Decision Tables), Logic control (conditional branching, loops), RAG, and Application interactions (external API calls via Webhook nodes).
*   **Workflow Management:** Includes features for workflow versioning, activation/deactivation status control, and detailed execution logging for monitoring and troubleshooting.
*   **Workflow Dashboard:** Provides a dedicated interface for monitoring workflow status, execution performance metrics, and success/error rates.

### 2.3 Decision Engine (Rules Management)

*   **Decision Tables:** Manages business logic through configurable Decision Tables, allowing definition of rules line by line.
*   **Rule Logic Evaluation:** Rules assess conditions based on input values, typically sourced from workflow data payloads.
*   **AI-Enhanced Decisioning:** Supports the integration of AI model outputs (from Model Nodes in workflows) as inputs into Decision Tables, enabling more sophisticated, hybrid decision logic.
*   **Business Configuration Inputs:** Allows rules within Decision Tables to utilize centrally defined and managed business parameters, such as Loan Products/Terms, Customer Segments, and Risk Thresholds.
*   **Audit & Compliance Logs:** Automatically records decision execution events, providing a traceable audit trail for compliance and review purposes.

### 2.4 Integration Framework & Defined API Endpoints

*   **Open API Approach:** Furnishes defined APIs based on standards like RESTful principles and JSON data formats for secure external system integration.
*   **Authentication & Authorization:** Implements authentication methods such as API Key/Secret pairs and includes management features with group-based permission controls.
*   **API Endpoint Categories:** Distinguishes between Core Endpoints (for platform module interaction, including `/v1/models` and `/v1/workflows`) and Business Logic Endpoints (for application-specific interaction, such as `/v1/loans` or custom workflow triggers).
*   **Data Exchange Patterns:** Supports both real-time API interactions and configurations for batch data processing.
*   **External Data Connections:** Provides capabilities to establish connections with client data sources (such as Snowflake or BigQuery) necessary for model retraining or fine-tuning activities.
*   **Third-Party Integrations:** The framework is designed to support integrations with common third-party providers (e.g., credit bureaus, payment gateways) via various methods (API, webhooks, batch files).

### 2.5 User Experience Layer & Embeddable Web Widgets

*   **Core Capability:** The platform enables the generation of embeddable Web Widgets.
*   **Widget Examples:** Configurable components designed for reuse, including widgets displaying Loan summaries, Application details, Model insights (scorecards), Rules results, or AI Chat interfaces.
