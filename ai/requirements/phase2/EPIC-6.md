### **Product Requirements Document (PRD): Enterprise User & Session Management (v1.0)**

**1. Introduction**

*   **1.1 Purpose and Vision:** To define the requirements to overhaul the user management, authentication, and settings sections of the platform. The vision is to transform these disparate and sometimes broken elements into a secure, professional, and cohesive user administration experience that aligns with enterprise security standards and user expectations.

*   **1.2 Background and Context:** The current user settings and authentication flow contain unprofessional elements (e.g., a public "Sign Up" button), lack standard security features (e.g., sign-out confirmation), and suffer from a confusing, broken navigation structure. These issues undermine user trust and present a poor first and last impression of the platform.

*   **1.3 Goals and Objectives:**
    *   **Product Goal:** Deliver a secure, enterprise-grade authentication and user settings experience that is intuitive, reliable, and instills confidence in the platform's professionalism.
    *   **User Experience Objectives:** Create a clean, logical, and frustration-free experience for managing profiles, security settings, and logging in/out.
    *   **Business Objectives:** Align the platform with standard enterprise security expectations, removing potential blockers in security reviews and sales processes.

**2. Problem Definition**

*   **2.1 Overview of the Problem:** The current user management flow is insecure for an enterprise product, and the settings navigation is a confusing mess of broken and duplicate links.
*   **2.2 Pain Points for Target Users:**
    *   **Administrators / Security Officers:** Are concerned by the presence of a public sign-up form and the lack of standard session control features.
    *   **All Users:** Can accidentally log out without confirmation, potentially losing unsaved work. They face a frustrating and confusing navigation experience when trying to access their profile or settings.

**3. Target Users**

*   **Primary:** All users of the platform who interact with the login/logout flow and need to manage their personal settings.
*   **Secondary:** Platform Administrators who rely on a secure and professional user provisioning model.

**4. Core Product Capabilities**

*   **4.1 Secure Authentication Flow:** A refined login/logout process with controlled user provisioning and deliberate sign-out confirmation.
*   **4.2 User-Centric Session Management:** User-configurable session timeout options to balance security and convenience.
*   **4.3 Navigation Cleanup:** A complete rationalization and consolidation of all user-related navigation and settings pages.

**5. Scope**

*   **In Scope:** All features outlined in Section 4.
*   **Out of Scope:** Advanced security features like Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), Single Sign-On (SSO) integration, or enterprise user directory sync (e.g., Active Directory). These are potential future enhancements.

**6. Success Metrics**

*   **Quality:** Zero user-reported bugs related to broken navigation links in the settings area within one month of release.
*   **Security:** The platform successfully passes an internal security review of its authentication and session management flow.
*   **User Satisfaction:** Positive qualitative feedback on the improved clarity and professionalism of the user settings area.

### **Epics, User Stories & Tasks**

---

### **Epic 1: Implement a Secure and Professional Authentication Flow (SET-AUTH-01)** ✅ **COMPLETED**

> **Goal:** To refine the entire authentication lifecycle to align with enterprise security best practices and provide a more deliberate, user-friendly experience.

**User Story 1.1:** ✅ **COMPLETED**
**As an** Administrator, **I want** user accounts to be provisioned only by invitation **so that** I can maintain strict control over who has access to our organization's instance.
*   **Tasks (TS-AUTH-01):** ✅ **COMPLETED**
    *   ✅ Remove the public-facing `Sign Up` button from the login page UI. This can be controlled via an environment variable or feature flag.
        - **Implementation**: Added `DISABLE_PUBLIC_REGISTRATION` environment variable check in `src/server/api/routers/auth.router.ts`
        - **Status**: Public registration now blocked when environment variable is set to 'true'
    *   ✅ Ensure the backend API route for public user creation is disabled or removed.
        - **Implementation**: API route throws `TRPCError` with code 'FORBIDDEN' when public registration is disabled
        - **Status**: Backend properly enforces registration restrictions
    *   ✅ Verify that the primary "new user" workflow is initiated from within the application's "User Management" section by an authorized admin.
        - **Status**: User Management section maintains admin-controlled user creation flow

**User Story 1.2:** ✅ **COMPLETED**
**As a** user, **when I** click "Sign Out", **I want** to be asked for confirmation **so that** I don't accidentally log out and lose unsaved work.
*   **Tasks (TS-AUTH-02):** ✅ **COMPLETED**
    *   ✅ Create a standardized confirmation modal component (if one doesn't already exist in the design system).
        - **Implementation**: Created `src/components/auth/SignOutConfirmDialog.tsx` using AlertDialog components
        - **Features**: Clean confirmation UI with "Cancel" and "Sign Out" options
    *   ✅ Modify the "Sign Out" button's `onClick` handler to open this modal first, instead of immediately triggering the sign-out function.
        - **Implementation**: Updated mobile navigation to use confirmation dialog
        - **Status**: Sign-out now requires explicit user confirmation
    *   ✅ The sign-out function will only be called from the `Confirm` button within the modal.
        - **Status**: Prevents accidental logout and potential data loss

### **Epic 2: Introduce User-Centric Session Management (SET-SESSION-01)** ✅ **COMPLETED**

> **Goal:** To provide users with control over their session duration, balancing enterprise security requirements with individual user convenience.

**User Story 2.1:** ✅ **COMPLETED**
**As a** user, **I want to** choose how long my session remains active **so that** I can tailor the platform's security behavior to my personal workflow.
*   **Tasks (TS-SESSION-01):** ✅ **COMPLETED**
    *   ✅ Design a new "Session Management" or "Security" section within the consolidated User Settings page.
        - **Implementation**: Session timeout options integrated into User Preferences section
        - **UI**: Clean radio group interface with 4 timeout options
    *   ✅ Build the UI with a clear set of selectable options (e.g., a radio group for "Sign out after 30 minutes of inactivity," "Keep me signed in for 7 days").
        - **Implementation**: Created custom radio group component with options:
          - 30 minutes (30)
          - 4 hours (240) 
          - 1 day (1440) - Default
          - 7 days (10080)
        - **Features**: User-friendly labels with descriptive text for each option
    *   ✅ Add a `sessionTimeoutPreference` field to the `User` or `UserPreference` database schema.
        - **Implementation**: Added `sessionTimeoutPreference: integer("session_timeout_preference").default(1440)` to users table in `src/db/schema/org.ts`
        - **Migration**: Successfully applied `drizzle/0009_glamorous_boom_boom.sql`
        - **Status**: Database schema updated and column exists with proper default
    *   ✅ Implement the tRPC mutation (`user.updateSessionPreference`) to save the user's choice.
        - **Implementation**: Added `updateSessionPreference` and `getCurrentUserSettings` procedures in `src/server/api/routers/user.router.ts`
        - **Features**: Type-safe mutations with proper validation and error handling
    *   ✅ Modify the backend authentication logic to use this saved preference when setting the expiration time of new session tokens.
        - **Implementation**: Enhanced JWT callback in `src/server/auth-simple.ts` to:
          - Load user session timeout preference from database
          - Enforce timeout based on user's preference
          - Automatically logout when session exceeds user-defined timeout
        - **Status**: Session management now respects individual user preferences
