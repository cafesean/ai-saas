# SAAS-20: Implement/Integrate Generic Charting Library - Task Scratchpad

## Task Overview
**Issue:** SAAS-20 - TS-FE08: Implement/Integrate a generic Charting Library
**Description:** Implement/Integrate a generic Charting Library (e.g., Recharts, Chart.js) to prepare for dynamic chart components

## Epic Context
This is **Phase 2: Dynamic Charts & Feature Drill-Down** from the Enhanced Model Detail & Inference Capabilities Epic. This prepares for:
- SAAS-21: Create dynamic chart components for `metrics.charts` (line_chart, bar_chart)
- Displaying ROC Curve, Confusion Matrix, Lift Chart, K-S Curve, Calibration Curve, etc.

## Technology Decision: Recharts vs Chart.js

### ✅ **Recharts** (Recommended Choice)
**Pros:**
- Built specifically for React/TypeScript
- Declarative API that fits React paradigm
- Smaller bundle size for React apps
- Better tree-shaking support
- Works well with Tailwind CSS
- Strong TypeScript support
- Good documentation and community

**Cons:**
- Fewer chart types than Chart.js
- Less customization flexibility

### Chart.js
**Pros:**
- More chart types and customization options
- Mature and widely used
- Great documentation

**Cons:**
- Larger bundle size
- Imperative API doesn't fit React well
- Requires react-chartjs-2 wrapper
- More complex state management

## Implementation Plan

### [X] Step 1: Install ECharts (Updated from Recharts)
- ✅ Removed Recharts
- ✅ Added ECharts and echarts-for-react
- ✅ Better choice for professional model visualizations

### [X] Step 2: Create Base Chart Components
- ✅ Created `BaseChart` wrapper with ECharts integration
- ✅ Implemented LineChart (for ROC Curve, K-S Curve, Calibration Curve)
- ✅ Implemented BarChart (for Feature Importance, Lift Chart)
- ✅ Added specialized components: ROCChart, CalibrationChart, FeatureImportanceChart
- ✅ TypeScript support with proper ECharts types

### [X] Step 3: Create Chart Theme/Configuration
- ✅ Configured default colors matching our UI theme (HSL CSS variables)
- ✅ Set up responsive chart containers with proper sizing
- ✅ Configured tooltips and legends with theme integration
- ✅ Accessibility compliance with proper labeling
- ✅ Created `withTheme` utility for consistent theming

### [X] Step 4: Create Sample Components
- ✅ Created `chart-samples.tsx` with example implementations
- ✅ Test data for ROC curves, feature importance, performance trends
- ✅ Demonstrates all chart types we'll use in SAAS-21

### [X] Step 5: Documentation & Testing
- ✅ Created comprehensive index.ts for easy imports
- ✅ TypeScript compliance verified
- ✅ Components ready for integration in SAAS-21

## Data Structure Context (from EPIC)
Charts will come from `model.metrics[0].charts_data` with structure:
```typescript
{
  name: string,
  type: 'line_chart' | 'bar_chart' | etc,
  x_axis: string,
  y_axis: string,
  data: any[]
}
```

Expected chart types from the EPIC:
- ROC Curve
- Confusion Matrix 
- Lift Chart
- K-S Curve
- Calibration Curve
- Precision vs. Threshold
- Recall vs. Threshold

## Technical Requirements
- ✅ TypeScript support
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Tailwind CSS integration
- ✅ Accessibility compliance
- ✅ Tree-shaking friendly
- ✅ Minimal bundle impact

## ✅ SAAS-20 COMPLETED!

**Summary:** Successfully implemented ECharts as our charting library with comprehensive components ready for model visualizations.

**Key Deliverables:**
1. **ECharts Integration** - Professional charting library with React wrapper
2. **Base Chart Component** - Themeable, responsive wrapper with dark/light mode support
3. **Line Chart Component** - For ROC curves, K-S curves, calibration curves
4. **Bar Chart Component** - For feature importance and lift charts  
5. **Specialized Components** - ROCChart, CalibrationChart, FeatureImportanceChart
6. **Theme System** - Consistent UI integration with HSL CSS variables
7. **Sample Implementation** - Working examples ready for testing

**Technical Achievements:**
- ✅ TypeScript support with proper ECharts types
- ✅ Responsive design with proper containers
- ✅ Accessibility compliance
- ✅ Theme integration with dark/light mode
- ✅ Professional tooltip and legend styling
- ✅ Modular, reusable component architecture

## Next Steps After SAAS-20
✅ **Ready for SAAS-21** where we'll create the actual dynamic chart components that consume `metrics.charts` data from the model metadata.
