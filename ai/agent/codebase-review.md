# Codebase Review Plan

## Task
Review and understand:
1. Project architecture standards
2. API patterns and tRPC implementation
3. Current codebase structure and functionality

## Progress

### Architecture Standards Review
[X] Review codebase-architecture.md
- Tech stack: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM, tRPC, Zustand
- Clear project structure with well-defined folders
- Strong emphasis on type safety and maintainable patterns
- Comprehensive coding conventions established

### API Patterns Review
[X] Review api-patterns-analysis.md
- Standard CRUD naming (list, create, update, delete)
- Relative imports for server code
- Use api.useUtils() for cache management
- Leverage tRPC's type inference

### Code Sample Analysis
[X] Review api-patterns code sample
- Clean tRPC implementation with proper separation of concerns
- Type-safe router setup with proper error handling
- Well-structured provider with query client configuration
- Follows best practices for CRUD operations and error handling

### Current Codebase Review
[X] Analyze existing files and structure
- Next.js project with TypeScript and modern tooling
- Uses pnpm for package management
- Database layer with both Drizzle and Prisma
- Well-organized src directory following Next.js conventions
- AI-assisted development tools and documentation

[X] Map out system functionality
- N8N integration (based on folder structure)
- Admin features including pricing
- API routes for various functionalities
- Strong focus on type safety and validation

[X] Document architectural patterns in use
- tRPC for type-safe API layer
- Drizzle ORM for database access
- Next.js App Router
- Tailwind for styling
- Proper separation of client/server code

## Notes
The codebase follows modern best practices with a strong emphasis on type safety and maintainable architecture. The API patterns sample provides a solid foundation for implementing tRPC endpoints. The current implementation appears to be focused on N8N integration with proper admin features.
