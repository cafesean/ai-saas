**Status:** In Progress

---

## 📋 **Epic Progress Overview**

### **Stories Created:**
- [X] SAAS-135 - Fix Critical Security Vulnerabilities in User Management Router (Highest) - **COMPLETED ✅**
- [X] SAAS-136 - Fix Critical Security Vulnerabilities in Role Management Router (Highest)  
- [X] SAAS-137 - Secure Admin Router and Remove Public Debug Context (High)
- [X] SAAS-138 - Standardize Permission Naming Conventions Across System (High)
- [X] SAAS-139 - Implement Route-Level Access Controls and Menu Visibility (High)

### **Implementation Priority:**
1. ✅ **SAAS-135** - User Management Router Security (CRITICAL) - **COMPLETED**
2. ✅ **SAAS-136** - Role Management Router Security (CRITICAL) - **COMPLETED**
3. 🔴 **SAAS-137** - Admin Router Security (HIGH) - **NEXT**
4. 🟡 **SAAS-138** - Permission Naming Standardization (HIGH)
5. 🟡 **SAAS-139** - Route-Level Access Controls (HIGH)

## ✅ **COMPLETED: SAAS-135 - User Management Router Security**

### **What Was Fixed:**
1. **Updated Permission Constants** (`src/constants/permissions.ts`):
   - Changed `user:` prefix to `users:` for consistency
   - Updated all role configurations to use new permission slugs
   - Added `users:assign_roles` permission for role management

2. **Secured User Router** (`src/server/api/routers/user.router.ts`):
   - `getAll` → `withPermission('users:read')`
   - `getById` → `withPermission('users:read')`
   - `create` → `withPermission('users:create')`
   - `update` → `withPermission('users:update')`
   - `delete` → `withPermission('users:delete')`
   - `bulkUpdate` → `withPermission('users:update')`
   - `bulkDelete` → `withPermission('users:delete')`
   - `assignRole` → `withPermission('users:assign_roles')`
   - `removeRole` → `withPermission('users:assign_roles')`

3. **Build Verification**: ✅ Build successful with no errors

### **Security Impact:**
🔒 **CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES FIXED**:
- User management now requires proper permissions
- No more unauthorized user creation/deletion
- Role assignment now properly protected
- Bulk operations secured

## ✅ **COMPLETED: SAAS-136 - Role Management Router Security**

### **What Was Fixed:**
1. **Added Role Permissions** (`src/constants/permissions.ts`):
   - Added `ROLE_PERMISSIONS` array with proper naming convention
   - Included in `ALL_PERMISSIONS` array for system integration
   - Created permissions: `roles:read`, `roles:create`, `roles:update`, `roles:delete`, `roles:assign_permissions`

2. **Secured Role Router** (`src/server/api/routers/role.router.ts`):
   - `getAll` → `withPermission('roles:read')`
   - `getById` → `withPermission('roles:read')`
   - `getWithPermissions` → `withPermission('roles:read')`
   - `getAllWithStats` → `withPermission('roles:read')`
   - `create` → `withPermission('roles:create')`
   - `update` → `withPermission('roles:update')`
   - `delete` → `withPermission('roles:delete')`
   - `assignPermissions` → `withPermission('roles:assign_permissions')`
   - `removePermissions` → `withPermission('roles:assign_permissions')`

3. **Build Verification**: ✅ Build successful with no errors

### **Security Impact:**
🔒 **CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES FIXED**:
- Role management now requires proper permissions
- No more unauthorized role creation/deletion
- Permission assignment now properly protected
- Role statistics viewing secured

## 🚀 **Current Task: SAAS-137 - Admin Router Security**

### **Analysis Plan:**
- [ ] Examine `src/server/api/routers/admin.router.ts`
- [ ] Identify all procedures lacking permission checks
- [ ] Plan admin permission structure
- [ ] Implement permission checks

### **Expected Admin Permissions:**
- `admin:system_settings` - Access system-wide settings
- `admin:audit_logs` - View audit logs and security events
- `admin:full_access` - Complete administrative privileges
- `admin:debug_context` - Access debug information (currently public!)

## 🔍 **Lessons Learned:**
- Authentication middleware was completely disabled (`matcher: []`)
- 47 procedures across multiple routers lack permission checks
- User router had 9 critical procedures completely unprotected ✅ FIXED
- Role router had 9 critical procedures completely unprotected ✅ FIXED
- Permission constants exist but need standardization
- Systematic approach works well for fixing security issues
- Build validation is critical after each change
