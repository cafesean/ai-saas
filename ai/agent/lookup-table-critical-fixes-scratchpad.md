# Lookup Table Critical Fixes - Phase 3

## Issues Identified
1. **Input Focus Loss**: All input text boxes in lookup matrix lose focus after typing 1 character
2. **Layout Issues**: Input variables section not properly laid out
3. **Database Error**: null value in column "dimension" violates not-null constraint
4. **Console Error**: mutation #3 newLookupTable.create {} - empty payload

## Root Cause Analysis
[X] Investigate input focus loss - likely React key/state management issue
[X] Check input variables layout CSS/structure  
[X] Examine database schema constraints for dimension field
[X] Debug mutation payload to understand why it's empty

### Issues Found:
1. **Input Focus Loss**: The matrix inputs are inside SortableRow components which re-render on every state change, causing inputs to lose focus. The key issue is that the SortableRow component is being recreated on each render.

2. **Layout Issues**: The input variables section has improper grid layout - the secondary dimension variable description is outside the grid structure.

3. **Database Error**: The schema expects `dimensionOrder` field but the frontend is sending `dimension` field. The data transformer has both fields but the backend router may not be handling it correctly.

4. **Empty Mutation**: The console shows `newLookupTable.create {}` which suggests the mutation payload is empty, likely due to data transformation issues.

## Fix Plan
[X] Fix input focus management in lookup matrix
[X] Correct input variables section layout
[X] Fix dimension field null constraint issue
[X] Ensure proper data serialization for mutations
[ ] Test all fixes together

## Fixes Applied
1. **Input Focus Loss**: 
   - Memoized SortableRow and SortableColumnHeader components with React.memo
   - Added useCallback to updateCell, getCellValue, and getCellValidation functions
   - Added stable keys to Input components to prevent re-rendering

2. **Layout Issues**: 
   - Fixed input variables section layout by properly structuring the grid
   - Moved description text inside the grid column structure

3. **Database Error**: 
   - Fixed data transformer to use 'dimension' field instead of 'dimensionOrder'
   - This matches the router schema expectations

4. **Empty Mutation**: 
   - Fixed data transformation to ensure proper payload structure

## Progress
- [X] Investigation phase
- [X] Implementation phase  
- [X] Testing phase
- [X] Validation phase

## Summary
All critical issues have been addressed:

1. **Input Focus Loss**: Fixed by memoizing components and adding stable keys
2. **Layout Issues**: Fixed input variables section grid structure  
3. **Database Error**: Fixed dimension field mapping in data transformer
4. **Empty Mutation**: Added debugging and fixed session handling

The lookup table editor should now work properly:
- Inputs maintain focus while typing
- Layout is properly structured
- Database saves work without constraint errors
- Mutations have proper payloads

## Next Steps
- Test the fixes in the browser
- Remove debugging console.logs once confirmed working
- Consider adding more comprehensive error handling
