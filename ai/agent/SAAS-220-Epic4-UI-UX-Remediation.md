# SAAS-220: Epic 4 - Comprehensive UI/UX Remediation

**Created:** 2025-06-24  
**Epic:** [SAAS-220](https://jira.jetdevs.com/browse/SAAS-220) - Comprehensive UI/UX Remediation  
**Goal:** Perform complete overhaul of Decision Engine UI, fixing all bugs and inconsistencies

## Context Priming - Epic 4 UI/UX Remediation

### Architecture Review:
- **Current UI Stack:** Next.js 14+ (App Router) + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Radix UI + Shadcn UI
- **Design System:** Tailwind-based with component variants using class-variance-authority
- **State Management:** Zustand + React Query (via tRPC)
- **Form Architecture:** React Hook Form with standardized patterns
- **Component Structure:** `src/components/ui/` (40+ atomic components) + `src/components/form/`

### Identified Constraints from Architecture:
- **UI Issues:** Multiple button implementations, inconsistent import paths, missing accessibility
- **Technical Debt:** Decision Engine has non-standard patterns vs. Global Design System
- **Component Standards:** Must follow established Radix UI + Shadcn patterns
- **Form Patterns:** Standardized `<Form>` with `<FormField>` components

### Cross-Referenced Issues:
- **UI/UX Standards:** Located in `src/styles/saas-ui-ux-rules.md`
- **Current Decision Engine:** Located in `src/app/(app)/decisioning/`
- **Component Library:** Multiple implementations need consolidation

### Approach Planning:
1. **Audit Current Decision Engine Pages** - Identify all UI/UX violations
2. **Standardize Component Usage** - Align with Global Design System patterns
3. **Fix Navigation Issues** - Broken Back button and inconsistent flows
4. **Implement Missing Functionality** - Duplicate, Export, Versioning, Testing utilities

## Epic 4 Stories & Tasks

### Story 1: SAAS-244 - Refactor module pages to align with Global Design System
**Tasks:**
- [ ] **SAAS-247:** Fix broken Back button on Lookup Table page
- [ ] **SAAS-248:** Refactor list pages to use standard ResourceListView component
- [ ] **SAAS-249:** Remove non-standard dashboard cards from module pages

### Story 2: SAAS-245 - Standardize interaction flows and usability patterns  
**Tasks:**
- [ ] **SAAS-250:** Eliminate read-only view on Lookup Table detail page
- [ ] **SAAS-251:** Standardize asset creation flow to use non-disruptive modal
- [ ] **SAAS-252:** Fix misplaced drag-and-drop handle in Lookup Table editor

### Story 3: SAAS-246 - Implement missing functionality for all Decision Engine artifacts
**Tasks:**
- [ ] **SAAS-253:** Implement functional Duplicate and Export actions
- [ ] **SAAS-254:** Implement versioning and Change Log history
- [ ] **SAAS-255:** Build built-in Test utility within Table editors

## Current Progress

### [X] Context Priming Complete
- ✅ Reviewed architecture.md for system overview
- ✅ Identified UI/UX standards in saas-ui-ux-rules.md
- ✅ Located Decision Engine module structure
- ✅ Understood design system constraints (Tailwind + Radix + Shadcn)

### [ ] Phase 1: Audit Current State
- [ ] Review Decision Engine pages for Global Design System compliance
- [ ] Identify all broken functionality (Back button, read-only views)
- [ ] Document component inconsistencies and missing features
- [ ] Map current vs. expected component usage patterns

### [ ] Phase 2: Fix Navigation & Layout Issues (Story 1)
- [X] **SAAS-247:** Fix broken Back button ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - **Issue:** Detail page used `router.back()` instead of proper breadcrumb navigation
  - **Fix:** Implemented standard Breadcrumbs component with proper navigation hierarchy
  - **Changes:**
    - Added `import Breadcrumbs from "@/components/ui/Breadcrumbs"`
    - Replaced inline Back button with breadcrumb items linking to `/decisioning/lookup-tables`
    - Updated layout to use standard pattern: `flex min-h-screen w-full flex-col bg-background`
    - Moved action buttons (Test, Edit, dropdown) to breadcrumb rightChildren
    - Added lookup table name as breadcrumb title with status badges
    - Applied consistent error and loading state layouts
  - **Result:** Navigation now follows Global Design System patterns across all states
- [ ] Move to SAAS-248: Standardize list pages with ResourceListView
- [ ] Complete SAAS-249: Remove non-standard dashboard cards

### [ ] Phase 3: Standardize Interaction Flows (Story 2)
- [ ] SAAS-250: Direct edit flows instead of read-only views
- [ ] SAAS-251: Modal-based creation flows
- [ ] SAAS-252: Fix drag-and-drop interface

### [ ] Phase 4: Implement Missing Features (Story 3)
- [ ] SAAS-253: Duplicate and Export functionality
- [ ] SAAS-254: Versioning and change history
- [ ] SAAS-255: Built-in testing utilities

## Key Design Principles to Follow

### 1. Global Design System Compliance
- Use established `src/components/ui/` components
- Follow button hierarchy patterns from saas-ui-ux-rules.md
- Consistent spacing and typography using Tailwind utilities

### 2. Navigation Patterns
- Breadcrumbs with right-aligned actions
- Consistent Back button behavior
- Standard page header structure

### 3. Form & Interaction Standards
- React Hook Form with standardized validation
- Save button states (active only when changes exist)
- Non-disruptive modal flows for creation

### 4. Component Reuse (DRY Principle)
- Standardize on single button implementation
- Use ResourceListView for all list pages
- Consistent action menu patterns

## Lessons Learned (To Be Updated)

### Best Practices
- Always follow React 19 optimization patterns (avoid over-memoization)
- Use direct inline onChange handlers per established patterns
- Maintain component size limits (300 lines max)

### Technical Standards
- End-to-end TypeScript with proper validation
- tRPC for type-safe API communication
- Proper error handling with TRPCError patterns

## Next Steps

**Immediate Action:** Start with comprehensive audit of Decision Engine pages to understand current state and prioritize fixes.

**Priority Order:**
1. Fix broken navigation (immediate user impact)
2. Standardize component usage (foundation for future work)
3. Add missing functionality (feature completeness)

**Status:** Planning Complete - Ready for Implementation
