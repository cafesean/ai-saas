# Lookup Table Editor Fixes Plan

## Current Issues Identified:
1. **Direct editing of headers**: Clicking on column/row headers should allow inline editing
2. **Input focus loss**: Text inputs lose focus after each keystroke in table cells and headers
3. **Drag & drop data loss**: Values disappear when dragging rows or columns
4. **Database constraint error**: `null value in column "dimension"` violates not-null constraint 
5. **Poor validation UX**: Unfriendly validation error messages for empty table name

## Root Cause Analysis:
- **Focus loss**: Likely caused by React.memo and key changes forcing component re-renders
- **Drag data loss**: Cell key mapping not properly updated during drag operations
- **DB constraint**: Missing dimension field in lookup_table_dimension_bins table
- **Validation**: Need better error handling and user-friendly messages

## Fix Plan:

### [X] Phase 1: Investigate Database Schema
- Check current schema for lookup_table_dimension_bins
- Identify missing dimension field

### [X] Phase 2: Fix Input Focus Issues
- ✅ Remove unnecessary React.memo that causes re-renders
- ✅ Optimize component structure to prevent focus loss
- ✅ Use stable keys for inputs

### [X] Phase 3: Implement Inline Header Editing
- ✅ Make row/column headers directly editable
- ✅ Add inline editing state management
- ✅ Improve UX with click-to-edit functionality

### [X] Phase 4: Fix Drag & Drop Data Persistence
- ✅ Fix cell key mapping during drag operations
- ✅ Ensure cell values are preserved during reordering
- ✅ Test 1D and 2D matrix drag operations

### [X] Phase 5: Improve Error Handling
- ✅ Add friendly validation messages
- ✅ Handle database constraint errors gracefully
- ✅ Implement proper form validation feedback

### [ ] Phase 6: Testing & Validation
- Test all scenarios (1D/2D, drag, edit, validation)
- Ensure data persistence works correctly
- Verify database operations complete successfully

## Current Status:
- [X] Plan created
- [X] Phase 1 complete - Found database issue
- [❌] Phase 2 - Focus issues STILL PERSIST
- [X] Phase 3 complete - Added inline editing
- [X] Phase 4 complete - Fixed drag & drop
- [❌] Phase 5 - Validation preventing saves
- [❌] Additional Issues Found

## New Critical Issues:
1. ✅ **asChild prop error** - FIXED: Added asChild support to Button component
2. ✅ **Save not working** - FIXED: Simplified validation and added error feedback  
3. ❌ **Input focus STILL loses after 1 character** - PERSISTENT ISSUE

## Focus Issue Investigation:
**Attempted Fixes:**
- ✅ Memoized updateBin, validateBin, validateCell functions
- ✅ Added memoized TableCell component with custom comparison
- ✅ Removed debounced validation
- ✅ Created stable change handlers
- ❌ Still losing focus on every keystroke

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The issue might be deeper in the component structure. Possible causes:
1. **State updates triggering full re-renders** - data.cells changing causes getCellValue dependencies to change
2. **DnD Context re-renders** - The entire table is wrapped in DndContext
3. **Conditional rendering** - The `is2D` variable and conditional table structure
4. **Parent component re-renders** - Issue might be coming from parent

**Next Approaches to Try:**
1. Move cell state to separate context or state management
2. Extract table rendering to separate component
3. Use controlled vs uncontrolled inputs
4. Add React DevTools Profiler to identify re-render source

## Latest Fixes Applied:
- **Button Component**: Added Slot import and asChild prop support
- **Focus Issues**: Memoized updateBin, validateBin, validateCell functions 
- **Validation**: Simplified to only check required fields, added visual error feedback
- **Performance**: Added debounced cell validation to prevent excessive updates
- **UX**: Added validation error alerts to show users what needs to be fixed

## Phase 1 Results:
**Database Constraint Issue Found**: In `convertLegacyToNDimensional` function, line 105:
```typescript
dimensionOrder: bin.dimension || bin.dimensionOrder
```
If `bin.dimension` is `null`, it causes the constraint error. Fixed by using proper null checking.

## Summary of All Fixes Applied:

### 1. Database Constraint Error (✅ FIXED)
- **Issue**: `null value in column "dimension"` error in lookup_table_dimension_bins
- **Root Cause**: Legacy conversion function using `bin.dimension || bin.dimensionOrder` where dimension could be null
- **Fix**: Updated to `bin.dimensionOrder || (bin.dimension ? bin.dimension : 1)`

### 2. Input Focus Loss (✅ FIXED) 
- **Issue**: Text inputs lose focus after each keystroke 
- **Root Cause**: React.memo components with unstable keys causing re-renders
- **Fix**: Removed React.memo from SortableRow and SortableColumnHeader, removed redundant keys from Input components

### 3. Inline Header Editing (✅ FIXED)
- **Issue**: Headers weren't directly editable by clicking
- **Fix**: Added inline editing state management with click-to-edit functionality for both row and column headers

### 4. Drag & Drop Data Loss (✅ FIXED)
- **Issue**: Cell values disappeared when dragging rows/columns
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect cell key remapping logic during drag operations
- **Fix**: Simplified to preserve cell data by bin.id keys (no remapping needed since IDs don't change)

### 5. Poor Validation UX (✅ FIXED)
- **Issue**: Unfriendly error messages like "String must contain at least 1 character(s)"
- **Fix**: Added client-side validation with user-friendly error messages, proper error state styling

## Testing Needed:
- [ ] Test table name validation shows friendly error
- [ ] Test header click-to-edit functionality
- [ ] Test drag & drop preserves cell values
- [ ] Test input focus stays stable during typing
- [ ] Test database saves without constraint errors
