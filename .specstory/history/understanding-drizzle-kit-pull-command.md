It looks like you're asking about the `drizzle-kit pull` command, which is typically used to synchronize your database schema with your Drizzle ORM setup. 

To run `drizzle-kit pull`, you generally need to ensure that:

1. **Database Connection**: Your database connection is properly configured in your Drizzle setup.
2. **Migration Files**: You have the necessary migration files or configurations set up in your project.
3. **Environment Variables**: Any required environment variables (like database URL) are set.

The command itself is usually run in your terminal like this:

```bash
npx drizzle-kit pull
```

This command will pull the current state of your database schema and update your Drizzle ORM models accordingly.

If you need to specify options or configurations, you can usually do that in a configuration file or directly in the command line, depending on your setup.

If you have a specific issue or error message when running this command, let me know, and I can help troubleshoot!
